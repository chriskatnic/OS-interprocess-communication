The program is broken into two processes. One is the sender, the other is the reciever.

The code was taken from the skeleton code provided on Titanium.

The sender is the first process that begins execution. 
The sender will create a key and assign it to a shared memory location.
The sender will then create a message queue (via key) and store the IDs
	into shared memory.

The sender will then open the file, and begin transferring that file
	into the message queue. 

Once complete, the sender will send a message stating that it is done.

At this point, the reciever begins execution. The reciever will generate a key
	and then attach to a shared memory address.

Once the reciever has attached itself to the message queue, it will
	begin to recieve the message and write to recvfile

Once the full message has been passed to recvfile, the sender will detach
	from shared memory, and the shared memory pointers will be deallocated

The program then exits, cleaning up the rest of the utilized memory.
